# ScriptScraper
Scraping Scripts from http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/free-script-downloads/ | 133 links, now who has time for that?

Using BeautifulSoup, urllib2, python, etc.

Unfortunately the site doesn't allow foreign requests so it was difficult to download those files with wget.
403 Forbidden is my bane.
