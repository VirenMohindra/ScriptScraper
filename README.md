Scraping Scripts from http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/free-script-downloads/ | 133 links, now who has time for that?


## Story Time

I attempted to use `BeautifulSoup`, `urllib2`, through `python`, to get all the `<a>` tags so I could batch download everything.

Unfortunately the site doesn't allow these requests so it was difficult to download **anything**.

*403 Forbidden is **my** bane.*

I then tried [Deep Vacuum](http://www.hexcat.com/deepvacuum/), which is a GUI for the `wget` command line interface. Mac OSX only. Didn't work.

I gave up, and ended up just downloading the first Google Chrome extension I could find, which was [Download Master](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-master/mcceagdollnkjlogmdckgjakjapmkdjf), set the exntension filters to PDF only, and pulled everything down!

Made my job so much easier, and now I can enjoy 133 scripts whenever I want.
